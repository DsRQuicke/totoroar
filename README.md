# Totoro AR
## Description
This is a small project I created to experiment with the AR module of WebXR (and also a little bit with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)).

It allows you to place an animated Totoro model in your surroundings.  
An AR capable device and a browser that supports the [AR module](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-ar-module) of the [WebXR API](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr) are required. You can see it in action [here](https://dsrquicke.github.io/totoroar)!

The GLTF Totoro model was created based on one of the many great models by [Patrick Fanart](https://www.facebook.com/PatrickFanart.HK). (See license notes below.)

The picture that was used in this image was dowloaded from [hero.fandom.com](https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Totoro). Although the site itself applies a CC BY-SA license, and the image is widespread on the internet, its actual license is not clear to me.

Note also that the Totoro model in this project (`assets/totoro.glb`) is based on the [Totoro model](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/art/totoro-family-my-neighbor-totoro) created by [Patrick Fanart](https://www.facebook.com/PatrickFanart.HK). Although the latter model is licensed under a [CC BY-NC-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) license, permission was granted by the author to share the my derived model in this project. (Thank you very much for that!)
